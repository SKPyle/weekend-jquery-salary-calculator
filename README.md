## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
I attempted to make a salary calculator. 

I was able to use JQuerty to target an unordered list and have that information reflected on the DOM. 
I am really struggling with the logic part of connecting different funtions using a render function. I have a few notes taken for class tomorrow as well as an adjusted study plan for going forwad. I left some comments in the js file to pick up where I have left off. This project is obviously not where it needs to be but I have been able to solidify some concepts with JQuery that had be completely stumped last week.
